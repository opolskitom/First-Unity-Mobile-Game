# First-Unity-Mobile-Game
 My first mobile Unity game created from scratch using C# scripts and various tutorials throughout the web.
 Created within around 3 days from very minimal knowledge, I am happy with how the game is turning out.
 
# How to Play
 Simply open the project in Unity and select the appropriate build settings, along with your target device if you are Unity Remote 5. Controls are basic swipe controls, and the goal is to collect the white ovals while dodging the blue circles. The game gets progressively more difficult as time goes on, how far can you go?
